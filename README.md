### Hi there, I'm Harun. ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning Python on my own with the help of Udemy.
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Python's main structures like "If - For - Functions"
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: GitHub: HarunUYGUC or StackOverFlow: Harun UyguÃ§.
- ğŸ’¬ You can something ask me about Python. 
- âš¡ My Thoughts: I've been thinking for almost a year about my further career and now I'm considering to be a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer. But my thoughts may change in the future.
